# Neural Network from scratch
## 1º project
This project is based on the building of a neural network from scratch, without using helpers like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

The neural network will be focused on solving a classification problem, and will have the following features:
· Number of layer
· Number of units in the hiden layers
· Activation function
· Minibatch or not
· Size of the minibatch (if corresponds)
·
